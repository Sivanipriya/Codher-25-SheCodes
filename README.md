We built:
🌍 Individual’s Carbon Footprint Detector

📌 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐰𝐞 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐭:
We developed a Data-Driven Web App that allows users to track their carbon footprint by inputting data on their lifestyle choices, including electricity consumption, transportation, and food habits. The app calculates an accurate carbon footprint score and provides personalized recommendations for reducing emissions.

🔍 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐬𝐞𝐭 𝐮𝐬 𝐚𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐭:
✅ Collaborative Filtering – to suggest sustainable actions based on similar users' behavior
✅ User-Based Similarity Modeling – finding like-minded users to benchmark eco-friendly habits
✅ Trend Analysis – visualizing carbon reduction over time
✅ Smart Recommendations – actionable insights to go greener
✅ Attribute Insights – identifying which lifestyle habits contribute most to emissions and how to change them

𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐫 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭:
To encourage continued interaction, we introduced a Points System where users earn points by improving their carbon footprint each month. If their current month’s footprint is better than the previous month’s, they get additional points. This fosters a sense of achievement and motivates users to continue adopting eco-friendly habits.
